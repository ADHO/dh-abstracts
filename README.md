__Abstracts Collection__     
This collection provides a central location for search, discovery, and preservation of conference abstracts submitted by attendees. The software platform, Xtensible Text Format (XTF), enables powerful indexing, keyword search, and faceted browsing for the material, all which has been encoded in TEI/XML. The current version, orginally implemented in approximately 2004, can be found here [digitalhumanities.org/dh-abstracts/search](http://digitalhumanities.org/dh-abstracts/search). The project work on this version so far has updated and rewritten the XTF implementation, improved the user interface, standardized display and documentation, and performed initial improvements on the XML encoded data.
